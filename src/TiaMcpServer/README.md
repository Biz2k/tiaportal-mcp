# TiaMcpServer

> The tool names in this document are the current ones; the authoritative list is `docs/tools-list.txt`, and every tool with its parameters is described in [`docs/tools/`](../../docs/tools/README.md). Names in `CamelCase` are methods of the `Portal` and `McpServer` classes.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the TiaMcpServer project, a C# application that acts as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to expose the Siemens TIA Portal API to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 1. Project Overview

The TiaMcpServer project is a .NET 4.8 console application that enables communication between an LLM and the Siemens TIA Portal. It achieves this by implementing an MCP server that exposes a set of tools for interacting with the TIA Portal. The project is divided into two main parts:

*   **MCP Server:** This part of the project is responsible for handling communication with the LLM. It uses the `ModelContextProtocol` library to create an MCP server that listens for requests from the LLM and executes the corresponding tools.
*   **TIA Portal Interfacing API:** This part of the project is responsible for interacting with the TIA Portal. It uses the Siemens TIA Portal Openness API to perform tasks such as connecting to the TIA Portal, opening and closing projects, and working with devices, blocks, and types.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

Both `Portal` and `McpServer` are `partial` classes split by functional area, so no single file
carries the whole surface.

*   **`ModelContextProtocol/`**: This directory contains the implementation of the MCP server.
    *   `McpServer.cs` and the partials beside it: all MCP tools, as partials of one `McpServer` type, split the same way as `Portal` in `Siemens/` below. The project-mutating tools are marked `[WriteTool]` and sit next to the read-only tools of their area; `Program.BuildTools` leaves them out when the server runs with `--read-only`, which keeps them out of `tools/list` rather than merely refusing them when called.
        *   `McpServer.cs`: connection, state, project and session tools, the project tree, `OpenTiaProject` and `PreviewImport`, plus the shared write plumbing (the `Guarded` wrapper, `SaveHint` and the response builders).
        *   `McpServer.Devices.cs`, `McpServer.Blocks.cs`, `McpServer.Types.cs`, `McpServer.Tags.cs`: devices; program blocks (including `GetBlockInterface`) and PLC data types, with their create, rename, delete, copy and move tools; tag, watch and force tables with their write tools.
        *   `McpServer.Documents.cs`: the source document tools for PLC data types and blocks (`ExportAsDocuments`, `ExportBlocksAsDocuments`, `ExportTypeAsDocuments`, `ExportTypesAsDocuments` and the matching `...FromDocuments` imports).
        *   `McpServer.Sources.cs`: the source file tools. `GetBlockSource`, `GetTypeSource`, `ExportPlcAsDocuments`, the external source tools incl. `ImportSourceBlocks`, and `ExportSourceBlock` / `ExportSourceType` / `GenerateSources`, which write files but never touch the project, so they are not `[WriteTool]`. `ImportSources` is the bulk-import counterpart to them.
        *   `Software/` (`McpServer.Software.*.cs`): software info and compile, the software tree, `ResolveObjectPath`, `FindInCode`, `GetPlcSummary`, and cross references (`GetCrossReferences`, `WhereUsed`).
    *   `WritePolicy.cs`: the `--read-only` gate (`--allow-write` is accepted for older configurations and does nothing).
    *   `Responses.cs` / `Responses.Write.cs`: the response objects returned by the tools. The write side shares `ResponseCreated`, `ResponseDeleted`, `ResponseRenamed`, `ResponseImported` and `ResponseGenerateBlocks` across all 37 tools rather than minting one DTO per operation.
    *   `Types.cs`: This file defines the data types that are used by the MCP server.
    *   `Helper.cs`: `GetAttributeList(IEngineeringObject)` reflects over any Openness object's attributes, so each new `Get*Info` tool is a few typed fields plus that call.
*   **`Siemens/`**: This directory contains the implementation of the TIA Portal interfacing API.
    *   `Portal.cs`: connection, project and session lifecycle, the project tree, and the `InTransaction` helpers.
    *   `Portal.Devices.cs`: devices and device items, resolved by path.
    *   `Software/` (`Portal.Software.*.cs`): everything about one PLC software, split by concern.
        *   `Portal.Software.Core.cs`: software lookup (`GetPlcSoftware` and the container resolvers) and `CompileSoftware`.
        *   `Portal.Software.Tree.cs`: the software tree, including the section renderers.
        *   `Portal.Software.Resolve.cs`: the generic path helpers (`WalkGroups`, `BuildGroupPath`, `WalkRecursive`). `PlcSoftware` exposes five look-alike group hierarchies - blocks, types, tag tables, watch and force tables, external sources - that share no common base type, so the shape is captured with generics plus selector delegates instead of inheritance.
        *   `Portal.Software.Lookup.cs`: `ResolveObjectPath` and `GetSoftwarePaths`.
        *   `Portal.Software.Search.cs`: `FindInCode`.
        *   `Portal.Software.Summary.cs`: `GetPlcSummary`.
        *   `Portal.Software.CrossReferences.cs`: `GetCrossReferences`.
    *   `Portal.Blocks.cs` / `Portal.Types.cs`: program blocks and PLC data types respectively - read, XML export/import, create/delete/rename, copy/move, and source text (`GetBlockSource`, `GetTypeSource`). Helpers shared by both (the guards and the scratch-directory handling) live in `Portal.Blocks.cs`.
    *   `Portal.Tags.cs`: tag tables, tags and constants, watch and force tables - both the read side and the write side.
    *   `Portal.Documents.cs`: SIMATIC source documents for PLC data types and blocks - the four `...AsDocuments` exports (`ExportAsDocuments`, `ExportBlocksAsDocuments`, `ExportTypeAsDocuments`, `ExportTypesAsDocuments`) and the matching `...FromDocuments` imports.
    *   `Portal.Sources.cs`: everything about TIA Portal source files. The source text readers (`GetBlockSource`, `GetTypeSource`) with their scratch directory, the whole-PLC source tree export, `ExportSourceBlock` / `ExportSourceType` / `GenerateSources` (write the `.scl`/`.db`/`.awl`/`.udt` files TIA Portal can compile back into blocks), its counterpart `ImportSources` (registers each file as a scratch `PlcExternalSource` via `CreateExternalSourceFromFile`, compiles it with `PlcExternalSource.GenerateBlocksFromSource`, then deletes the scratch source again), and the external source methods including `ImportSourceBlocks`.
    *   `Operation.cs`: the single exception-decoration point (see `docs/error-model.md`), which also serializes all Openness traffic behind a reentrant lock.
    *   `State.cs`: This file defines the `State` class, which represents the state of the TIA Portal.
    *   `Openness.cs`: This file provides a wrapper around the Siemens TIA Portal Openness API.
    *   `Diagnostics.cs`: the environment report behind `--doctor` and the `Doctor` tool.

## 3. Architecture

The TiaMcpServer project follows a client-server architecture. The LLM acts as the client, and the TiaMcpServer application acts as the server. The communication between the client and the server is handled by the MCP protocol.

The MCP server is responsible for receiving requests from the LLM, executing the corresponding tools, and returning the results. The tools are implemented as methods in the `McpServer` class. These methods use the TIA Portal interfacing API to interact with the TIA Portal.

The TIA Portal interfacing API is implemented in the `Siemens` directory. This API provides a set of classes and methods for performing common tasks, such as connecting to the TIA Portal, opening and closing projects, and working with devices, blocks, and types.

## 4. Functionality

The server publishes 139 tools (70 in `--read-only` mode); `docs/tools/` has one page per area, generated from the descriptions in the code.

*   **Connection and state:** `connect` (the first running TIA Portal, or the one chosen with `processId` / `projectPath`; `get_tia_instances` lists them), `disconnect`, `get_state`, `doctor`.
*   **Projects and sessions:** `open_tia_project`, `open_project`, `get_project`, `save_project`, `save_as_project`, `close_project`, `get_project_tree` (`depth`, `filter`, `structured`).
*   **Devices:** `hw_get_devices`, `hw_get_device_info`, `hw_get_device_item_info`, `hw_get_topology`, `hw_search_catalog`, and the write tools `hw_create_device`, `hw_plug_module`, `hw_delete_device`.
*   **Network:** `net_connect_subnet`, `net_disconnect_subnet`, `net_delete_subnet`, `net_create_io_system`, `net_connect_to_io_system`, `net_get_connections`, `net_create_connection`, `net_delete_connection`.
*   **PLC software:** `plc_get_software_info`, `plc_get_software_tree` (with `sections`), `plc_get_summary`, `plc_resolve_object_path`, `plc_find_in_code`, `plc_compile_software`, `plc_compile_block`, `plc_get_cross_references` (with `maxDepth`) and `plc_where_used`.
*   **Blocks and types:** `plc_get_blocks`, `plc_get_blocks_hierarchy`, `plc_get_block_info`, `plc_get_block_data`, `plc_get_block_interface` (data blocks only), `plc_get_block_source`, `plc_get_types`, `plc_get_type_info`, `plc_get_type_source`, and the write tools to create, rename, delete, copy and move them. List tools take `limit` and `offset`.
*   **Tags, constants, watch and force tables:** `plc_get_tag_tables`, `plc_get_tags`, `plc_get_constants`, `plc_get_watch_tables`, `plc_get_force_tables` and their `info` tools; `plc_create_tag`, `plc_update_tag`, `plc_delete_tag`, the user-constant tools and the batch tool `plc_manage_tag_table_entries`.
*   **External sources:** `plc_get_external_sources`, `plc_create_external_source`, `plc_generate_sources` and the delete tools.
*   **Export and import:** `export_objects` and `import_objects` take blocks, types and tag tables as XML, SIMATIC documents (V20+, V21 for types) or source files, with a per-object result and the conflict policy `overwrite` or `skip`; `preview_import` checks files before they are imported.
*   **Libraries:** `get_libraries`, `get_master_copies`, `get_library_types`, `open_global_library`, `instantiate_master_copy`.
*   **Download:** `get_download_targets`, `download_to_plc`.
*   **WinCC Unified:** screens and items, faceplates, trend controls, tags and tag tables, scripts, logs and logging tags, connections, alarms and alarm classes, text and graphic lists, runtime settings and system tags - the `unified_*` tools. Classic WinCC (Comfort / Advanced / Professional) is not covered.
*   **Writing:** every tool that changes the project is marked `[WriteTool]` and is left out when the server starts with `--read-only`; the changes stay in memory until `save_project`.

## 5. Conclusion

The TiaMcpServer project is a powerful tool that allows LLMs to interact with the Siemens TIA Portal. The project is well-structured and easy to understand. The code is well-commented and follows best practices.

## 6. Future Improvements

*   **Session Path Reliability:** The `GetOpenSessions` method has been updated to return the full path of the session project. However, the TIA Portal Openness API's behavior with multiuser sessions can vary. Future testing should confirm the reliability of retrieving the `Path` for all types of local and remote sessions to ensure the information is always accurate.

## Known Issues

- As of 2025-09-02: Importing Ladder (LAD) blocks from SIMATIC SD documents requires the companion `.s7res` file to contain en-US tags for all items; otherwise import may fail. This is a known limitation/bug in TIA Portal Openness.

## Transports

- Current transport: `stdio`
  - The server is hosted with `AddMcpServer().WithStdioServerTransport()`.
  - For stdio, all logs must go to stderr.
- Streams transport: available in SDK (not wired here)
  - The SDK also exposes `WithStreamServerTransport(Stream input, Stream output)` which can be used to host over TCP or other custom streams.
- HTTP (planned)
  - This repo does not yet include an HTTP or SSE transport. The plan is to add a CLI flag `--transport http` and host a loopback `HttpListener` that forwards POST `/mcp` to the MCP request handler, then iterate towards MCP Streamable HTTP compliance.

## Error Handling Standard (ExportXmlBlock)

- Portal layer
  - Throws `PortalException` with a short message and `PortalErrorCode`.
  - Attaches context via `Exception.Data` keys: `softwarePath`, `blockPath`, `exportPath`.
  - Preserves the original exception as `InnerException` for `ExportFailed` and logs full details.
- MCP layer
  - Rethrows as `McpException`. Since SDK 2.x an `McpException` thrown from a tool becomes a `CallToolResult` with `isError: true` carrying the message as text, instead of a JSON-RPC error, so the model can read the reason and retry.
  - For `NotFound`, if `blockPath` is a single name, it suggests likely full paths by scanning blocks.
  - For `ExportFailed`, includes a concise reason from `InnerException.Message`.
  - Consistency: TIA Portal does not export inconsistent blocks/types. Single-item exports fail with a message advising to compile first. Bulk exports skip inconsistent items and include them in an `Inconsistent` list in the response.
  - Keeps user messages concise; structured details live in logs and context.
  - Current standardization is applied to `ExportXmlBlock` and will be rolled out to other methods incrementally.
  - Exception metadata: Context keys (e.g., `softwarePath`, `blockPath`/`typePath`, `exportPath`) are attached in a single catch per portal method just before rethrow, not at inline throw sites. See `docs/error-model.md`.

## Comfort Functions

Tools added to shorten the path between a question and an answer. All are read-only and none
change an existing tool's contract; `plc_compile_software` was enriched in place rather than
duplicated. Every one is verified against a live TIA Portal V21.

| `export_objects`      | Writes one PLC data type as a `*.udt` external source file                                                          | the document export, which needs V21             | Works on every supported version, and the result can be imported again.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `plc_generate_sources`       | Writes every block and type of a PLC as sources into a tree mirroring the project groups                            | One `export_objects` call per object              | The compilable counterpart to `export_objects`. Objects with no source form, inconsistent ones and know-how protected ones land in `Skipped` rather than failing the run.                                                                      |

`plc_get_blocks` and `plc_get_types` now also return `Path`, which had been commented out on
`ResponseBlockInfo` and `ResponseTypeInfo`. Exporting one type is a single call again instead of
list, then build the path, then export.

`plc_generate_sources`' write-side counterpart, `import_objects`, is a write tool rather
than in the table above because it mutates the project: it walks a tree of `.db`/`.awl`/`.scl`/
`.udt` files - typically one `plc_generate_sources` just wrote - and compiles each back into a block
or PLC data type, in the group its folder path implies. See the External sources row of the
write tool table below.

### Write safety

Every project-mutating tool now runs inside `ExclusiveAccess.Transaction`, applied once in the
`Guarded` helper rather than per tool. A tool call commits as a unit and appears in the TIA
Portal undo stack as one named entry (`MCP: <tool>`); a body that throws rolls back instead of
leaving the project half-edited. If TIA Portal refuses exclusive access the write still runs
unwrapped, so the wrapper can never turn a working write into a failure.

## TIA Portal Openness API Surface

The Openness API has thousands of members, so this is the set **this server actually calls**,
grouped by area, with what each one backs. It is the map to consult before adding a tool: if a
